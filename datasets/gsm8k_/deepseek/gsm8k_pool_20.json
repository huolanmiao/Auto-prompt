    "Question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
    "Rationale": "Natalia sold 48 clips in April. In May, she sold half as many, which is 48 / 2 = 24 clips. To find the total number of clips sold in April and May, we add the two amounts together: 48 + 24 = 72 clips.",

    "Question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
    "Rationale": "First, we need to convert the 50 minutes into hours since Weng earns by the hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equivalent to 50/60 = 5/6 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate her earnings: $12 per hour * (5/6) hours = $10.\n\nWeng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.",

    "Question": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?",
    "Rationale": "Betty has half of the money she needs, which is $100 / 2 = $50. Her parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, which is 2 * $15 = $30. So, in total, she received $15 + $30 = $45 from her parents and grandparents. Now, she has $50 + $45 = $95. To buy the wallet, she needs $100, so she still needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.",

    "Question": "Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?",
    "Rationale": "Julie has already read 12 pages yesterday and today she read twice as many, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pages. So in total, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. The book has 120 pages, so there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages remaining. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.",

    "Question": "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?",
    "Rationale": "James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends. This means he writes 3 pages * 2 friends = 6 pages per writing session. He does this twice a week, so he writes 6 pages * 2 times per week = 12 pages per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so in a year he writes 12 pages per week * 52 weeks = 624 pages.",

    "Question": "Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?",
    "Rationale": "First, let's find out how many purple flowers there are. Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, and there are 10 yellow flowers, the number of purple flowers is 10 + (0.8 * 10) = 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many green flowers there are. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. So, the total number of yellow and purple flowers is 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) = 28 flowers. Therefore, the number of green flowers is 0.25 * 28 = 7 green flowers.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of flowers in Mark's garden, we add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers: 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 7 (green) = 35 flowers.",

    "Question": "Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?",
    "Rationale": "Albert buys 2 large pizzas, each with 16 slices, so that's 2 * 16 = 32 slices from the large pizzas. He also buys 2 small pizzas, each with 8 slices, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 slices from the small pizzas. In total, he has 32 + 16 = 48 slices of pizza. If he eats it all, he eats 48 pieces that day.",

    "Question": "Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?",
    "Rationale": "Ken started with a box that weighed 2 pounds after adding jelly beans. Then, he added enough brownies to triple the weight, so the weight became 2 pounds * 3 = 6 pounds. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the total weight to 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight again, so the final weight became 8 pounds * 2 = 16 pounds.",

She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?",
    "Rationale": "Alexis started with a budget of $200. She spent $30 on a shirt, $46 on pants, $38 on a coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. The total amount she spent on these items is $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143. After these purchases, she had $200 - $143 = $57 left. However, she has $16 left after purchasing the shoes. Therefore, the amount she spent on the shoes must be $57 - $16 = $41.",

    "Question": "A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",
    "Rationale": "Let's denote the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years as \\( x \\). Since each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the last, the number of people on the ships in the second and third hundred years would be \\( 2x \\) and \\( 4x \\) respectively.\n\nOver three hundred years, the total number of people consumed is:\n\\[ x + 2x + 4x = 7x \\]\n\nWe know that the total number of people consumed is 847, so:\n\\[ 7x = 847 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{847}{7} = 121 \\]\n\nSo, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.",

    "Rationale": "First, we need to find out how many coconut trees Randy has. He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. Half of the mango trees is 60 / 2 = 30. So, he has 30 - 5 = 25 coconut trees.\n\nNow, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees together: 60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees.",

He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?",
    "Rationale": "Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $10 / 2 = $5. The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $10 * 2 = $20. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and cold cuts: $10 + $5 + $20 = $35.",

    "Rationale": "Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes her to read 1 page, we divide 20 minutes by 8 pages: 20 / 8 = 2.5 minutes per page.\n\nNow, to read 120 pages, we multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages: 2.5 minutes/page * 120 pages = 300 minutes.\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.\n\nSo, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.",

    "Rationale": "The profit is shared in the ratio 2:5, which means for every 2 parts Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts. If Johnson got $2500, then 5 parts equal $2500. Therefore, 1 part equals $2500 / 5 = $500.\n\nMike gets 2 parts, so he gets 2 * $500 = $1000.\n\nAfter spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $1000 - $200 = $800 left.",

If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.",
    "Rationale": "First, let's calculate the total number of hard hats initially:\n26 pink + 15 green + 24 yellow = 65 hard hats.\n\nCarl takes away 4 pink hard hats, so there are now 26 - 4 = 22 pink hard hats left.\n\nJohn takes away 6 pink hard hats, so there are now 22 - 6 = 16 pink hard hats left.\n\nJohn also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed, which is 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats. So there are now 15 - 12 = 3 green hard hats left.\n\nNow, let's add up the remaining hard hats:\n16 pink + 3 green + 24 yellow = 43 hard hats.\n\nThe total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 43.",

    "Rationale": "Roque walks to and from work three times a week. Since it takes him two hours to walk to work and two hours to walk back, each walk trip takes 2 + 2 = 4 hours. Over three trips, he spends 3 * 4 = 12 hours walking.\n\nRoque rides his bike to and from work twice a week. Since it takes him one hour to ride to work and one hour to ride back, each bike trip takes 1 + 1 = 2 hours. Over two trips, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours biking.\n\nIn total, Roque spends 12 hours walking and 4 hours biking, which adds up to 12 + 4 = 16 hours.",

    "Rationale": "First, let's calculate the total distance Tim bikes during the workdays. He rides back and forth, so he travels 2 * 20 miles each day. Over 5 workdays, he travels 5 * (2 * 20) = 5 * 40 = 200 miles.\n\nHe also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. So, the total distance he bikes in a week is 200 (workdays) + 200 (weekend) = 400 miles.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time he spends biking. Since he bikes at 25 mph, the time he spends biking is the total distance divided by his speed: 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours.\n",

Since 30 snakes are eaten by the jaguars, the snakes would have eaten 30 * 3 = 90 birds per day.\n\nEach bird eats 12 beetles per day. Since 90 birds are eaten by the snakes, the birds would have eaten 90 * 12 = 1080 beetles per day.\n\nTherefore, the total number of beetles eaten each day is 1080.",

    "Rationale": "Jamie's last name is Grey, which has 4 letters. If Bobbie took 2 letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's, which means Bobbie's last name would be 4 * 2 = 8 letters long after removing 2 letters. Therefore, Bobbie's original last name must have been 8 + 2 = 10 letters long. Since Samantha's last name has 3 fewer letters than Bobbie's, Samantha's last name must have 10 - 3 = 7 letters.",
