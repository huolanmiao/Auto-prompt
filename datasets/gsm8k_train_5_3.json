    "Question": "Mike can type 65 words per minute. Due to a minor accident, Mike cannot use his right hand for a while so that his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute. If he is supposed to type a document with 810 words, how many minutes will it take him to finish typing the document?",
    "Rationale": "N/A",
    "Answer": "After the accident, Mike can only type 65 words/minute - 20 words/minute = <<65-20=45>>45 words/minute.\nSo, he will be able to finish typing the document in 810 words / 45 words/minute = <<810/45=18>>18 minutes.\n#### 18",
    "Ground_truth": "18"

    "Question": "A cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph.  The gazelle can run for speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.  If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?",
    "Rationale": "N/A",
    "Answer": "60 mph is 60*1.5=<<60*1.5=90>>90 feet per second.\n40 mph is 40*1.5=<<40*1.5=60>>60 feet per second.\nThus, for every second, the cheetah advances on the gazelle by 90-60=<<90-60=30>>30 feet per second.\nTo close on a distance of 200 feet, it would take the cheetah 210/30=7 seconds to catch the gazelle.\n#### 7",
    "Ground_truth": "7"

    "Question": "A publishing house decides to create a contest for new writers and will award a total of $800 in prizes to the 18 novels with the most votes. First place will get $200, second place will get $150, third place $120 and the rest of the awards will be paid with the same amount of money. How much money will each writer earn from fourth place onwards?",
    "Rationale": "N/A",
    "Answer": "The first three cash prizes sum to $200 + $150 + $120= $<<200+150+120=470>>470\nThe remaining amount of cash prizes to be distributed is $800 - $470= $<<800-470=330>>330\nThe number of novels left to be awarded is 18 \u2013 3= <<18-3=15>>15 novels\nSo each writer from 4th to 18th will earn $330 / 15= $<<330/15=22>>22\n#### 22",

    "Question": "Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 100 empty cans for their Science project. As of today, Alyssa collected 30 while Abigail collected 43 empty cans. How many more empty cans should they collect?",
    "Rationale": "N/A",
    "Answer": "Alyssa and Abigail collected a total of 30 + 43 = <<30+43=73>>73 empty cans as of today.\nSo, they still need to collect 100 - 73 = <<100-73=27>>27 more empty cans.\n#### 27",

    "Question": "Santana has 7 brothers. 3 of them have birthdays in March, 1 of them has a birthday in October, 1 has a birthday in November, and another 2 of them were born in December. If Santana always buys each of her brothers a birthday present and a Christmas present, how many more presents does she have to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year?",
    "Rationale": "N/A",
    "Answer": "Santana has 1 + 1 + 2 = <<1+1+2=4>>4 brothers with birthdays in the second half of the year.\nShe has 7 brothers - 4 brothers = <<7-4=3>>3 brothers with birthdays in the first half of the year.\nAltogether, she has to buy 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11 presents in the second half of the year.\nTherefore, she has to buy 11 - 3 = <<11-3=8>>8 more presents in the second half of the year.\n#### 8",
